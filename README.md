## Have a moment?  
Q: How will robotics of the REAL work with humans to compute at critical moments?  
Q: Does your magic 8's priors indicate Isaac Asimov's children will drown?  

> Cooper (human)  
> -- Get ready to match our spin with the retro-thrusters  

>> CASE (robot)  
>> -- It's not possible.  

> Cooper  
> -- No. **It's necessary.**

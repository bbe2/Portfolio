```
Currently, I engage in foundational work in machine and
assembly language, transitioning from LC-3 to C++ (based
on the Patt/Patel approach). My focus spans theoretical
system design, its practical re-engineering, and STEM
technical communication. In Spring 2023, I authored course
COSC.5236 data mining for www.utk.edu.    

My pedagogical approach prioritizes active learning, utilizing
interactive frameworks based on Google Sheets, Github,
and Colab. Like bee festooning or forming chains to
repair and branch, students similarly festoon in
collaborative JAM sessions, connecting ideas and
solving challenges for day one career preparedness.   

An embodiment of a Lacanian real, I call new.REAL is
central to my teaching paradigm. Education is a performative
act, lived and crafted, not just passively consumed. The
paradigm challenges traditional passive learning and draws
on Arthur Kroker's concept of body drift, i.e., a blend
of humanity with technology and Foucault's active
knowledge structures. Students don't absorb but actively
shape, create, and immerse themselves where education isn't
symbolic but a tangible, actionable commodity echoing
Baudrillard's simulacrum.
Efforts aim to showcase immediate skills and value.     

To augment classroom learning, I use generative pretrained transformer APIs to,  
- Summarize the audio lecture and lecture notes.   
- Identify and synthesize disparities between audio lectures and lecture notes.   
- Email outcomes and then aggregate all media into a central repository.   
- Harness substrate for bespoke AI.agent development enabling
-- students to pose intricate curriculum-related queries for precise answers.   
- My work centers on furthering accessibility and recall mnemonics.

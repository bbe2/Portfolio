```
Currrently I instruct foundational compute from machine
and assembly with LC-3 via patt/patel to C++. My expertise
also spans theoretical system design, practical re-engineering,
data transformation and programming constructs, and STEM
communication, complemented by my data science training
and course authorship, like COSC-526 data mining with Spark.

I employ an active learning pedagogy, leveraging tools like
Colab, G Sheets, and Github. Taking inspiration from bee
festooning, students collaborate in JAMs, linking concepts
and tackling challenges, like analyzing a physical book's
word count within an hour. My aim? Equip students with
immediate, tangible skills for preparedness during un.REAL
talent and task replacement.

An embodiment of a Lacanian real, a Krokeresque new.REAL
central to my teaching paradigm. Education is a performative
act, lived and crafted, not just passively consumed. The
paradigm challenges traditional passive learning and draws
on Arthur Kroker's concept of body drift, i.e., a blend of
humanity with technology and Foucault's active knowledge
structures. Students don't absorb but actively shape, create,
and immerse themselves where education isn't symbolic but a
tangible, actionable commodity echoing Baudrillard's simulacrum.
Efforts showcase immediate skills, use of abstraction,
ontological formation, and problem decomposition.

Augment student learning and engagement with generative pretrained transformers that
I.	Convert lecture audio to text and integrate into class corpus.
II.	Use GPT tech to synthesize disparities including lecture notes and textbook.
III.Email disparity index and aggregate media into a central repository.  
IV.	Feed repository into a course specific AI agent further supporting student tasks.
V.	Facilitate upskill and recall mnemonics while postively experiencing a new.REAL of our social fabric.

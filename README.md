Computer science departments should consider assessing students' programming skills each year and having learning modules to address missing skills. I am happy to elaborate on the 5 core modules I'm designing to address this essential need before ChatGPT solves it all! :)  

One core is data transformation, including indexing, positionality, and read / reporting basics of text and csv data in R and Python. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(computing)

Part I of VII, self-paced training modules on Python's classes, conditionals, data objects, functions, iterators, libraries, and transformers.  
ðŸ‘€   7 Pillars of Python  
ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘‹ 7 Pillars of R (expected 3Q23)  

7 Pillars focuses on Python because can cast unfamiliar data objects to Python built-ins (dictionary, list, etc).
Students quickly GET this.

### some computer science departments want to see writing of core scripts even if available in common libraries  
i don't disagree, but feel it should be part of a cheatsheet with purpose, variations, how to know if working right, and what current libraries perform it well. In the last month alone (from 02.04.23) I've experience 8 students discussing how they use ChatGPT to survive coding classes but do so with a low retention rate. There needs to be a balance towards solving the problem and getting assistance as needed until more advanced

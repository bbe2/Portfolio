B.	course: >_7.Pillars.Python.Skills	  
Formulated a novel Python course for learners to experience neuroplasticity with data object transformation by coding iterators, conditionals, and functions with class objects to deliver outcomes.  
•	Targets learners who question if their skills provide dependable, specific means to transform data for stats and machine learning.  
•	Builds sophistication in numeric and text data pack and unpack.  
•	Provides means to decode new libraries and learn objects quickly.

Q: How will robotics of the REAL work with humans to compute at critical moments?  
Do priors indicate Isaac Asimov's children will drown?  

> Cooper (human)  
> -- Get ready to match our spin with the retro-thrusters  

>> CASE (robot)  
>> -- It's not possible.  

> Cooper  
> -- No. **It's necessary.**

Computer science departments should consider assessing students' programming skills each year and having learning modules to address missing skills. I am happy to elaborate on the 5 core modules I'm designing to address this essential need before ChatGPT solves it all! :)  

One core is [data transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(computing)), including indexing, positionality, and read / reporting basics of text and numeric data in R and Python. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(computing)

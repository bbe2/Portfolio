Research Situation  
23-bed, 63-nurse and associate acute care floor	June 2021 - Jan 2022  
Winchester Hospital	 

#### A: Evidence-based practice - hourly rounding  
Investigated the efficacy of evidence-based practice purposeful hourly rounding on patient falls and length of stay satisfaction.  
• Performed research, monthly data coding, and statistical analysis.  
• Designed the data collection and encoded three months of daily patient measurement data.  
• Performed REDCap API data transfer training in R software with the CRAN data.table package.  
• Outcomes: associate chief nursing officer presented the methods, viability, and benefits of adopting purposeful hourly rounding.  
**Outcomes:** included situational fall factor nurse prevention and locating upgrade parts for the call bell system in a 23 bed, 70 staff department.   

#### B: Evidence-based practice - Call bells  
Assisted in evaluating call bell signal standardization across units to help distinguish noncritical care requests from critical requests.  
•	Located call bell system parts but wasn't able to upgrade the system.
